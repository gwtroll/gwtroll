Gulf Wars XXXIII  merchants sell by invitation and must conform to the policies established regardless of license. Merchants sell at their own risk. </p>

                <p><b>Gulf Wars Merchant Agreement</b></p>
                <p>I, the undersigned merchant for myself and my agents, employees and affiliates, have read and understood the accompanying information and regulations and agree to abide by all rules established by the state of Mississippi, The Society for Creative Anachronism, King's Arrow Ranch Campground, and the Autocrat Staff of Gulf Wars XXXIII. By registering to be a merchant, I am declaring that I have the proper business permits to sell in Mississippi and will pay the Mississippi sales taxes through the Gulf Wars merchant office.   I acknowledge that I am solely responsible for all permits and fees associated with vending.
                    I acknowledge that I am an independent operator and neither I nor my agents, employees or affiliates have any authority to contract or incur liability for or obligation on behalf of the S.C.A., Gulf Wars XXXIII, King's Arrow Ranch Campground or any of their agents; and will indemnity the above entities against any and all claims that may be made against them due to my activities. I assume responsibility for any claims, costs, expenses or attorney fees incurred by King's Arrow Ranch or Gulf Wars XXXIII due to my activities.
                    I agree that if anyone using the assigned merchant space fails to comply with these rules or any portion at this agreement. King's Arrow Ranch, the Autocrat and Merchant Staff may take immediate steps which in their sole judgment may be necessary to protect Gulf Wars XXXIII interests. Including, but not limited to, the closing of the contracted selling site, removal of selling materials, removal of merchant and halting all merchant activities at King's Arrow Ranch without refund of any fees to the merchant.
                    I acknowledge that King's Arrow Ranch is a private property with the right to limit the hours, locations and operation of any and all businesses on its premises.
                    I acknowledge that the assigned merchant space is non-transferable, and that use is limited to the persons listed with this agreement and assume responsibility for the actions of all and any persons who use the assigned space.
                    Parcels shipped to King's Arrow Ranch are done so at my own risk; neither King's Arrow Ranch nor Merchant Staff, nor Gulf Wars XXXIII is responsible for any items delivered to the site.
                    I will, by the closing time of 12 Noon Sunday March 16, 2025, remove all equipment, supplies, merchandise, propane bottles, and trash from the assigned space, and pay all charges, including all merchant and camping fees.  I assume responsibility for any hauling charges or other expenses incurred for disposal and for cleanup of the merchant site occupied.</p>
