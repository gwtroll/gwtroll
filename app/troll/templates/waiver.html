    biting, stamping, stumbling, rearing, and others; tack equipment can fail resulting in falling or loss of control; 
    and activities have the potential of a participant to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to injury to 
    the participant or others, such as failing to maintain control over the equine or not acting within the participant’s
